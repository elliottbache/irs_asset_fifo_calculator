# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this project! This repo contains a Python tax calculator, 
tests (pytest), docs (Sphinx), and Docker setups.

## Quick start

1. **Fork & clone** your fork.
2. **Create a virtualenv** (Python 3.11+):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. **Install deps** (dev extras included):
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```
4. **Build docs** (optional quick check):
```bash
sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html
```
5. Run tests & linters:
```bash
pytest -q
ruff check --select I .
black --check --diff .
codespell
mypy src
```

See "Quickstart" and "Installation" sections of [README.md](README.md) for more details.
## Branch & commit style
- **Branch names**: ```feat/<short-desc>```, ```fix/<short-desc>```, ```docs/<short-desc>```, ```chore/<short-desc>```
- **Commits**: Prefer Conventional Commits
  - Examples: ```feat(calculate_taxes): add Docker capabilities, fix(Makefile): remove clean from make run```

## Making changes
- Keep Python code formatted with **Black**; keep imports & lint happy with **Ruff**.
- Add **type hints** for new/changed functions (mypy runs on ```src/```).
- Add/adjust **pytest** tests (unit or integration) for behavior changes.
- Update **Sphinx docs** when applicable (```docs/```), and include short “What changed?” in PR description.

## Running integration locally
- **Direct Python** (after `pip install -e .`):
```bash
irs-fifo-taxes
```
- **Docker**:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
See "Quickstart" section of [README.md](README.md) for more details.

Notes:
- The CSV file with transactions must first be placed in the repo root (or any other director
specified with the ```--input-file=``` flag).

## Test matrix & quality gates
The CI runs on every push/PR:
- `pre-commit` (format/lint/type checks as configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- `pytest`
- `sphinx-build`

Please run these locally before opening a PR:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest -q
sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html
```

## Opening a Pull Request
- Fill in the PR template checklist.
- Link any related issues (```Fixes #123```).
- Keep PRs focused & reviewable (prefer smaller PRs).

## Reporting bugs / requesting features
- Use the ```Issue templates``` (Bug/Feature).
- For security issues, please ```do not``` open a public issue.  Send an email to elliottbache@gmail.com.
